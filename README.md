# Huffman_Coding

In this project, we implement the miminal prefix coding algorithm that produces a lossless compression of a file also known as Huffman Coding; the initial idea was created by David Huffman. In this implentation we follow a basic algorithm that scans a file and determines the frequency of all values. Next we use a priority queue to sort the characters in the file based on the frequency. Afterwards a binary tree is created from the priority queue where the higher frequency characters are near the top. Finally we can travel through the binary tree and scan the dtat sctructure to build a new file with the encoding of the original file. Overall the concept from David Huffman is very useful to learnign about data transmission and statistical coding.

## Key Feautures

- Programmed in Java
- Used Priority Queue Implementations
- Used Binary Tree Implementations
- Created and Utilized Recursive Functions 

## Data Structure Class

This course deepened my knowledfe of software design through the lenses of an object-oriented perspective. I learned to implemented commmon data structures to organize and manipulate data such as linked lists, recursion, binary trees, and hash tables to list a few. I was made aware of the tradeoffs software developers have to deal with when designing projects and how to handle them. The class also allowed students to explore algorithms and structures in standard code.
