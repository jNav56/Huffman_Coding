What kinds of file lead to lots of compressions? What kind of files had little or no compression?

	Files that have a lot of the same repeated information tend to lead to a lot more compression versus other files 
	with a varying of distinct characters.

	Bigger files tend to have more compression versus smaller files which in some cases have more data when compressed.

What happens when you try and compress a huffman code file?

	The compression file gets bigger.
